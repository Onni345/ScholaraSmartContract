        The Proposal struct represents the main piece that authors/reviewers/general users interact with. 
        It contains many useful things to delineate papers from one another, including a title, abstract,
        wallet address of the author. The wallet address being stored on the blockchain ledger guards against
        privacy and intellectual property concerns --the first to post a paper is forever immutably held 
        as an author. The ipfs hash is also important because it links our DAO to a public decentralized 
        data storage network using the interplanetary file system (IPFS). This lets any user read papers. The 
        proposal has yes and no votes and variables to show if it has been approved by reviewers, and if the
        DAO vote has been executed. It also has a timestamp and a dynamic mapping of all voters to see if the 
        DAO members have actually voted/contributed (address maps to a boolean).
